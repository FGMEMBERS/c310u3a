Description by Dave Haskell from the original release notes:

This depiction of the Cessna U-3A was based on photographs of the real thing.  The real 
aircraft is a restoration of a U.S. Navy Cessna 310B known as a U-3A or the Blue Canoe.  
The U.S.N. used them for pilot proficiency checks, personnel transport and other duties
and I believe around a dozen or so were aquired from the US Air Force and Army.
This aircraft was bought as a stock C310 by Dave Miller in 1994, he has since done
a complete rebuild on it and transformed it into an aircraft representitive of the U-3's
of the 1960's.  He has since won the Best Replica Warbird at both Sun 'n Fun
and EAA AirVenture Oshkosh. It was the article in December '98's Sport Aviation
magazine that inspired me to produce this panel and to ask Chris Lampard to build
the aircraft.
